          <h2>Father of the nation</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela</b> (1918-2013) was South Africa's first black president, 
            serving from 1994 to 1999. A leading anti-apartheid activist, he focused on racial 
            reconciliation, dismantling apartheid's legacy. Born into the Thembu royal family, he 
            studied law and became involved in politics, joining the ANC in 1943. Mandela led protests, 
            endured arrests, and was imprisoned for 27 years. Released in 1990, he negotiated the end of 
            apartheid, won the 1994 election, and formed a coalition government. Mandela emphasized 
            reconciliation and established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Internationally, he 
            mediated conflicts and advocated for social justice. Despite controversies, Mandela earned global 
            acclaim, receiving over 250 honors, including the Nobel Peace Prize. He's revered in South Africa 
            as "Madiba", the "Father of the Nation", symbolizing democracy and equality.
